# authentication
 

To Run the App please go to the terminal of your IDE and type: 

         npm run dev | yarn run dev
         
         
1.The First page when the application Loaded is the Login Page, I use firebase backend to store all the data and authentication for the Login Process

2. If you do not have an account yet. Press the "Don't Have An Account?" button to navigate to the Register Page

3. Fill out the Register Page following the template I have given to register your first account.

4. When Registed Successfully you will be sent to your Profile Page where at first would mostly be blank.

5. There is a 2 buttons which helps you navigate inbetween whether to view your Profile or to Update your Profile

6. When Updating the Profile please follow the given Format to get the best Experience.

7. After Updating the Profile, please navigate to the Profile Tab to see instance Update of your personal Profile.

8. There is a Log out button below if you want to try creating another Account to test the Application.

Programs that I use:

-Vite instead of create-react-app, In my opinion Vite runs alot faster
-SCSS
-React-Router to navigate between pages
-Firebase as the backend

*As per requirement I do not want to make the application too complicated which brings me to building a simple design which highlight the application's functions.

Thank you for Testing the Application :)
